Standup Minutes

Day 1 - 10/10/16
We completed six schema models and pushed them all to Staging-Branch. The schema models are file, pic, profile-pic, profile, stats, and user. We added the appropriate extraneous fles, i.e. .eslintrc, .gitignore, etc. We wrote out our model.md and we will plan routes for the day. Heroku and Travis will be implemented later today upon Duncan's arrival.
